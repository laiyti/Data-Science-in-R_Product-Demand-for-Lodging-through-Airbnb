## Project Background

  Airbnb has revolutionized the hospitality industry by providing a platform for homeowners to rent out their properties and travelers to find unique accommodation options. As the platform continues to grow, hosts face increasing competition, making it crucial for them to optimize their listings to attract guests and maximize their booking rates.

  This data science project aims to answer the question: How do guests book on Airbnb? What's the secret behind properties with such high booking rates? It seeks to address this challenge by developing a predictive model to identify properties with a high booking rate on Airbnb. By leveraging a diverse array of features ranging from property attributes to host characteristics, our model will provide actionable insights to empower hosts in enhancing their rental business performance.

## TargetAudience
Our predictive model is tailored for Airbnb hosts seeking to improve their rental property's booking rate and overall profitability. Additionally, property management companies, real estate investors, and Airbnb itself can benefit from the insights generated by our model to inform decision-making processes and drive business growth.
