## Project Background

  Airbnb has revolutionized the hospitality industry by providing a platform for homeowners to rent out their properties and travelers to find unique accommodation options. As the platform continues to grow, hosts face increasing competition, making it crucial for them to optimize their listings to attract guests and maximize their booking rates.

  This data science project aims to answer the question: How do guests book on Airbnb? What's the secret behind properties with such high booking rates? It seeks to address this challenge by developing a predictive model to identify properties with a high booking rate on Airbnb. By leveraging a diverse array of features ranging from property attributes to host characteristics, our model will provide actionable insights to empower hosts in enhancing their rental business performance.

## TargetAudience
Our predictive model is tailored for Airbnb hosts seeking to improve their rental property's booking rate and overall profitability. Additionally, property management companies, real estate investors, and Airbnb itself can benefit from the insights generated by our model to inform decision-making processes and drive business growth.

## Interest Insight In Features

### Text Mining: Natural Language Processing (NLP) And Sentiment Analysis
The original dataset comprises various customer review texts. We applied NLP techniques and sentiment analysis to transform these texts into scores, reflecting customer satisfaction with specific aspects of the property and its management. Additionally, we engineered new features such as positive_score, transit_score, interaction_score, and space_score to quantify satisfaction across different categories.

### Amenities
We used K-Means to cluster amenities into 10 groups to analyze their impact on availability. Across most markets,listings with amenities from cluster 2 tend to be booked more frequently. Notably, hosts in Seattle favor amenities from cluster 7, indicating strategic preferences for boosting bookings.

### Distance To Airport
With our domain knowledge, we hypothesize that distance from the airport significantly affects Airbnb
listing booking rates. From the violin plot, we observe that the median distance for both high and low
booking rate listings is similar. However, the distribution of the violin area suggests that listings farther from the airport are more likely to have lower booking rates.

## Evaluation and Modeling
### Model Overview
Our team created 6 models, including Logistic, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, Boosting, and Random Forest. Discussing splitting the data in detail, we separated into training, testing, and validation data. Then we took the training data to train our model and predict our model on the validation data to get the AUC value. After running all the models, we plotted the models’ AUC curves on the same plot and chose the top 3 winning models with the best AUC then trained the whole data to receive the models’ probability. Finally, we averaged these models’ probability for the final prediction.

We selected three winning models based on their performance evaluated through the average model evaluation performance (AUC) on cross-validation. Our final winning models are: ***random forest, XGboost, boosting***. Subsequently, we further validated their performance using a small held-out dataset, which was utilized only once. This final validation step with the small dataset aims to mitigate the risk of overfitting on the validation data.

### Model Performance
| Model Name | AUC |
| --- | --- |
| Random Forest | 0.88 |
| Boosting | 0.88 |
| XGBoosting | 0.86 |
| Logistic | 0.84 |
| Ridge | 0.84 |
| Lasso | 0.84 |

## Business Insights Based On Model & Analysis Findings
### Host Characteristics Improvement
When guests choose properties on Airbnb, they often consider not only the property itself but also the characteristics of the host. For example, our model includes features associated with host information, such as whether the host is a superhost, whether they have a profile picture, whether their identity is verified, whether they have a hotel license, and their responsiveness or acceptance rate. By incorporating these features into our model, we can explore the relationship between these host characteristics and high booking rates. Hosts can then focus on improving these characteristics that are important to guests.

### Property Adjustment
Hosts can also utilize our model to optimize their properties. For instance, we include features associated with the properties, such as the number of bedrooms, bed type, property type, etc. Hosts can then tailor their properties to target specific guest demographics by adjusting these characteristics. Additionally, we analyzed amenities using the k-means method to identify any particularly popular amenities in certain areas. By leveraging this analysis, hosts can make informed decisions not only in choosing properties wisely but also in adjusting amenities based on location, following a data-driven strategy.

### Optimizing the free text field
We conducted text analysis on features such as 'summary',
'transit', 'interaction', and 'space'. We created new features which are the scores of the aforementioned text features, calculated as the difference between the number of positive words and negative words. Additionally, we explored the text features by building models and variable importance plots. Through the variable importance plots, hosts can identify common keywords appearing in properties with high booking rates. Hosts can then optimize the free text field accordingly to make their properties appear more attractive to potential guests.

### Market Expansion and Location Selection
Our model will help hosts choose a location if they are planning to start a new Airbnb. Identifying new opportunities for expansion by analyzing factors contributing to high booking rates in different locations. Hosts can use our model to assess the potential profitability of expanding their rental business to new markets and target areas with high demand and favorable booking rates. For example, we used features associated with location in our model, such as 'market', and we also created features such as 'nearby_airport' and 'nearby_attractions' to indicate whether the property is close to the airport or famous attractions. Analyzing these features can provide hosts with a clearer picture of how location influences high booking rates.

### Pricing Strategy
Adjust pricing based on demand patterns and market dynamics to maximize revenue while remaining competitive. Our model can provide insights into optimal pricing strategies tailored to specific properties and market conditions.
Guest Experience Enhancement: Focus on enhancing the overall guest experience by addressing any shortcomings identified by the model. This may involve improving amenities, addressing maintenance issues, or providing additional services to exceed guest expectations and encourage positive reviews.

### Feature Importance
The plot below uses the random forest to generate a features importance chart and see which variables are more important to the model in two aspects, giving us some insight.
